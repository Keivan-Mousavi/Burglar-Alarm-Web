# Burglar Alarm Web

<p>
  I used .net 5 because it supports webassembly and it is very fast. Also uses powerful libraries .net.

  The procedure is that if you receive a warning from the <a href="https://github.com/Keivan-Mousavi/Burglar-Alarm-ESP8266">audio module</a> that sends a notification to the mobile and then allows images to be uploaded to the server. Stores images in memory and displays them on a screen. In the mobile section, it can also receive images as a web API or receive images on one page.
